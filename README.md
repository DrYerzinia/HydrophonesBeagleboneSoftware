# PRU MAX11043 ADC Driver

This is a driver to bit bang SPI on the beaglebone PRU to configure and capture data from the MAX11043 ADC.  This data is transfered to the linux system and ARM processor using RPMsg.

This must be compiled on the beagle bone, and you need to have the PRU compiler installed on the beagle bone to compile it.
